## Description

Your project description.

An OTP (One-Time Password) REST service designed to provide a secure, cloud-agnostic, and production-grade solution for applications requiring enhanced security for sensitive actions such as financial transactions or secure logins.

## Key Features

- **Infrastructure Setup**

  - Comprehensive infrastructure setup using Docker and Kubernetes.
  - Ready-to-deploy configurations for various cloud platforms, ensuring cloud-agnostic deployment.

- **Security**
  - OTPs generated using cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNG).
  - End-to-end encryption for OTP transmission.
  - Secure storage of OTPs using strong hashing algorithms like SHA-256.
- **Simplicity and Usability**

  - Simple setup with detailed documentation and configuration files.
  - RESTful API endpoints for OTP generation, validation, and management.
  - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

- **Scalability and Performance**

  - Caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) for fast access and temporary storage of OTPs.
  - Distributed cache setup with replication and automatic failover.
  - Load balancers and distributed caching solutions for high load scenarios.

- **Failure Management**

  - Redundant and distributed cache with automatic failover.
  - Monitoring and alerting mechanisms for cache and application health.
  - Fallback mechanisms for temporary storage and processing during cache unavailability.
  - Retry logic and exponential backoff for OTP validation failures.
  - Comprehensive error logging and user feedback for failed transactions.

- **Practical Considerations**
  - Length and complexity configuration for OTPs to ensure they are not easily guessable.
  - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
  - Time-based validation and auto-expiration for OTPs.
  - One-time use enforcement to enhance security.
- **Continuous Testing and Updates**
  - Regular stress testing and simulations of failure scenarios.
  - Up-to-date software and security patches.

This repository provides a robust and secure OTP service designed to meet the needs of modern applications, ensuring both security and scalability. The infrastructure and code are designed for easy setup and deployment, making it an ideal solution for developers looking to integrate OTP functionality into their systems.

**Note:** This service focuses solely on OTP generation, sending, and verification. It does not handle authentication.
